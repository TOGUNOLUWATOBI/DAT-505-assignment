## 📖 Which Guide Should I Read First?

### 🆕 Complete Beginner (Never used VMs or Linux):
1. **Start with**: `VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - Understand what you're actually doing
2. **Then read**: `COMPLETE_BEGINNERS_GUIDE.md` - Detailed step-by-step instructions
3. **Use**: `ABSOLUTE_BEGINNER_CHECKLIST.md` - Quick reference while working

### 🔧 Some Experience (Used VMs before):
1. **Start with**: `ABSOLUTE_BEGINNER_CHECKLIST.md` - Quick setup steps
2. **Reference**: `COMPLETE_BEGINNERS_GUIDE.md` - When you need more detail
3. **Use**: `ASSIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Track your progress

### 💻 Technical Background (Know Linux/networking):
1. **Start with**: `README.md` - Technical overview
2. **Use**: `ASSIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Assignment requirements
3. **Reference**: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Complete feature list

## 🎯 What Am I Actually Doing?

In simple terms, you're learning how hackers can:
1. **Intercept internet traffic** (like reading someone's mail)
2. **Redirect websites** (send people to fake sites)
3. **Capture passwords and data** (steal information)

**But you're doing this safely** in a controlled virtual environment to learn how to **DEFEND** against these attacks!

---

## ⏱️ How Long Will This Take?

### Time Breakdown:
- **Setup (first time)**: 3-4 hours
- **Running attacks**: 1 hour  
- **Collecting evidence**: 1 hour
- **Writing report**: 2-3 hours
- **Total**: 7-9 hours

### Recommended Schedule:
- **Day 1**: Set up virtual machines (3-4 hours)
- **Day 2**: Run attacks and collect evidence (2 hours)
- **Day 3**: Write report (2-3 hours)

---

## 🛠️ What Do I Need?

### Required:
- **A computer** (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- **8GB+ RAM** (for running multiple VMs)
- **50GB+ free disk space** (for VM files)
- **Good internet connection** (to download OS images)
- **Time and patience** (learning takes time!)

### Optional but Helpful:
- **Second monitor** (easier to manage multiple VMs)
- **Fast SSD** (VMs run faster)
- **Previous Linux experience** (but not required!)

---

## 🚨 Safety First!

### ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING:
These are **real hacking tools**. You must:
- ✅ **ONLY use in isolated virtual machines**
- ✅ **NEVER test on real networks** (school, work, home WiFi)
- ✅ **Keep everything in your virtual lab**
- ❌ **NEVER attack networks you don't own**

**Breaking these rules = Getting expelled + Criminal charges**

## 🗺️ Step-by-Step Roadmap

### Phase 1: Understanding (30 minutes)
- [ ] Read `VISUAL_GUIDE.md` to understand the concepts
- [ ] Watch: "What is ARP spoofing?" on YouTube (optional)
- [ ] Review assignment requirements in `ASSIGNMENT_CHECKLIST.md`

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Download and install VirtualBox
- [ ] Download Linux ISO files (Kali, Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server)
- [ ] Create 3 virtual machines
- [ ] Configure isolated network
- [ ] Install the attack tools

### Phase 3: Testing Setup (30 minutes)
- [ ] Verify all VMs can communicate
- [ ] Test that attack tools show help messages
- [ ] Take VM snapshots (backup before attacks)

### Phase 4: Running Attacks (1 hour)
- [ ] Run ARP spoofing attack
- [ ] Capture network traffic
- [ ] Perform DNS spoofing
- [ ] Verify attacks are working

### Phase 5: Evidence Collection (1 hour)
- [ ] Take screenshots of ARP tables
- [ ] Capture network traffic in Wireshark
- [ ] Document successful website redirections
- [ ] Save all generated log files

### Phase 6: Report Writing (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Use `report_template.md` as starting point
- [ ] Document your lab setup
- [ ] Explain attack results with evidence
- [ ] Discuss defense strategies
- [ ] Address ethical considerations

## 🆘 What If I Get Stuck?

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**"I don't understand networking"**
→ Read `VISUAL_GUIDE.md` - it explains everything with pictures

**"VirtualBox is confusing"**
→ YouTube: "VirtualBox tutorial for beginners"

**"Commands don't work"**
→ Make sure you're using `sudo` and in the right directory

**"VMs can't talk to each other"**
→ Check all VMs are on "Internal Network" named "lab-network"

**"Nothing happens when I run attacks"**
→ Verify network setup with `ping` commands between VMs

**"I'm overwhelmed"**
→ Take breaks! This is complex material. Focus on one step at a time.

## 🎓 Learning Mindset

### Remember:
- **Everyone was a beginner once** - Even experts started somewhere
- **It's okay to not understand everything** - Focus on getting it working first
- **Mistakes are learning opportunities** - That's why we use VMs!
- **Ask for help** - Your instructor wants you to succeed

### This Assignment Teaches:
- Real cybersecurity skills used by professionals
- How network protocols actually work
- Why security measures exist
- Critical thinking about technology
