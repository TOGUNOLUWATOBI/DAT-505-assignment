# 🎨 Visual Guide: Understanding Network Attacks

## 🏠 Lab Setup Diagram

```
Your Computer (Host)
├── VirtualBox Software
    ├── VM #1: Attacker (Kali Linux)    IP: 192.168.1.100
    ├── VM #2: Victim (Ubuntu Desktop)  IP: 192.168.1.10  
    └── VM #3: Gateway (Ubuntu Server)  IP: 192.168.1.1
                     │
            [Internal Network: lab-network]
```

**Think of it like**: Three separate computers in a room, connected by an invisible network cable.

---

## 🌐 Normal Network Flow (Before Attack)

```
Victim Computer                Gateway                Internet
[192.168.1.10] ────────────► [192.168.1.1] ────────► [Websites]
      │                           │
      │ "I want to visit          │ "I'll forward this
      │  google.com"              │  to the internet"
      │                           │
      ◄───────────────────────────◄ [Response comes back]
    "Here's google.com"
```

**What happens normally**:
1. Victim says "I want google.com"
2. Request goes to Gateway
3. Gateway forwards to internet
4. Response comes back through Gateway to Victim

## 🎯 ARP Spoofing Attack

### Step 1: Normal ARP Table
```
Victim's ARP Table (Who is Where):
192.168.1.1 (Gateway) = MAC: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
```

### Step 2: ARP Spoofing Attack
```
Attacker sends fake messages:
"Hey Victim! I'm the Gateway now!"
"Hey Gateway! I'm the Victim now!"

    Victim                 Attacker               Gateway
[192.168.1.10] ◄─────► [192.168.1.100] ◄─────► [192.168.1.1]
                     "I'm in the middle!"
```

### Step 3: Poisoned ARP Table
```
Victim's ARP Table (Now Corrupted):
192.168.1.1 (Gateway) = MAC: xx:yy:zz:aa:bb:cc  ← Attacker's MAC!
```

**Result**: All traffic flows through attacker!

## 📡 Traffic Interception Flow

```
Normal Flow:
Victim ────────► Gateway ────────► Internet

After ARP Spoofing:
Victim ────────► Attacker ────────► Gateway ────────► Internet
                    │
                    ▼
               [Captures Everything]
               - HTTP requests
               - DNS queries  
               - Passwords
               - Emails
```

**What the attacker sees**:
- Every website the victim visits
- Every search they make
- Any unencrypted data

---

## 🎭 DNS Spoofing Attack

### Normal DNS Process:
```
1. Victim: "What's the IP for google.com?"
2. DNS Server: "It's 172.217.164.14"
3. Victim connects to real Google

Victim ────────► DNS Server ────────► Real Google
   "google.com?"    "172.217.164.14"     [Real Website]
```

### DNS Spoofing Attack:
```
1. Victim: "What's the IP for google.com?"
2. Attacker intercepts and responds first: "It's 192.168.1.100" (fake!)
3. Victim connects to attacker's fake server

Victim ────────► Attacker ────────► Fake Website
   "google.com?"    "192.168.1.100"    [Attacker's Server]
                         │
                         ▼
                   [Fake Google Page]
                   "You've been hacked!"
```

**Result**: Victim thinks they're on Google, but they're on attacker's fake site!

## 🛡️ How Defenses Work

### ARP Protection:
```
Static ARP Entry:
"192.168.1.1 ALWAYS = aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff"
Cannot be changed by fake ARP messages!

ARP Monitoring:
[Security Tool] ────► "Alert! ARP table changed!"
```

### DNS Protection:
```
DNS over HTTPS (DoH):
Victim ────────► [Encrypted Tunnel] ────────► Trusted DNS
         Can't be intercepted or spoofed!

DNSSEC:
DNS Response + Digital Signature = Verified Authentic
```

## 🎓 Real-World Impact

### What Attackers Could Do:
```
Coffee Shop Attack:
Customer ────────► Fake WiFi ────────► Attacker's Laptop
    │                                      │
    ▼                                      ▼
Thinks they're on                    Steals passwords,
cafe WiFi                           credit cards, emails
```

### Why This Matters:
- **Hotels**: Fake WiFi networks
- **Airports**: Evil twin access points  
- **Corporate**: Insider threats
- **Home**: Compromised routers

### Modern Protections:
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Encrypts web traffic
- **VPNs**: Create secure tunnels
- **Certificate Pinning**: Prevents fake certificates
- **Network Monitoring**: Detects suspicious ARP activity

## 🔍 Evidence You're Collecting

### Screenshots Show:
```
Before Attack:
ARP Table: 192.168.1.1 = real-gateway-mac

During Attack:
ARP Table: 192.168.1.1 = attacker-mac-address ← Proof of success!

DNS Spoofing:
Browser shows: "You've been redirected!" ← Proof DNS spoofing worked
```

### Files Prove:
- **PCAP files**: Network traffic was captured
- **CSV files**: Specific HTTP/DNS requests logged
- **JSON files**: Attack statistics and timing
